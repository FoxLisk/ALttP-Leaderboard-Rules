## Goal: All Dungeons

1. Timing starts on file select and ends upon entering the Triforce room.
2. **Obtaining a sword at any point is banned.**
3. All bosses must be defeated. This means all bosses at the end of a dungeon which drop a heart container, and both Agahnim fights. Specifically for this category, Ganon does not need to be killed, since it is not possible to do so without a sword.
4. Collecting all of the pendants and crystals is required. This can be done by any means.
5. Rescuing Zelda in Hyrule Castle to end the rain state is required.
6. An input display is preferred but not required.
