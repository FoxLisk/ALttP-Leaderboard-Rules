Given that this game is popular and has many very optimized times, submissions will be held to high scrutiny, particularly those near the top of the leaderboard. Please be prepared to show additional proof of legitimacy if asked. This may include a recorded history of attempts, if you are not already regularly streaming them, or some other proof that you are capable of playing at the skill level your submission indicates.

The minimum guidelines defined below will, in the vast majority of cases, be enough to ensure legitimacy of your submission, and so we ask that you follow them regardless of your time.

These rules apply to the entire leaderboard, unless otherwise specified by the category's rules.

---------------------
GLOBAL RULES
---------------------
 
1) Only official Japanese, American and European versions are allowed.
 
2) Turbo is banned. 

3) Pressing Up+Down or Left+Right simultaneously is banned.

4) RAM Preparation is banned. Power cycle or soft reset before your run to prevent this.

5) FOR TIMES IN TOP 20%:
* Game Audio MUST be present.
* The full credits should be shown at the end of the run.
* Runs should begin with a soft (or hard) reset.

EMULATOR RULES
-------------------------
 
1) Allowed emulators are SNES9X (v.1.5 and later) and BSNES (including higan/byuu).

2) Front-ends running a valid SNES9X or BSNES emulator core are allowed (Retroarch, BizHawk, etc.).

3) Emulator or front-end specific functionality is banned (e.g. save states, binding multiple keys, run-ahead, etc).

4) One-to-one mapping is required between buttons/keys and inputs. An exception is made for controllers which require mapping diagonals (e.g. Logitech, etc.).

5) Input must be continually registered for the duration of the button being depressed (e.g. pressing and hold a direction must register as pressing and holding, not just a single frame of input).

6) FOR TIMES IN TOP 20%:
* FPS must be displayed for the duration of the run.
* Emulator name/version should be visible or shown at the end of the run.
* The input configuration (button mappings) must be visible or shown at the end of the run.
* Runs on Retroarch and other emulators with the option must show that Run-Ahead was disabled.
